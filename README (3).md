# working of remote directories


  this file generate remote servers(lets say directory )  and in these directories  automatic log files generate every 5 seconds in every directory and directory number also auto increase.


```bash
   
   run automatic.sh
  
```

to transfer the file from remote directories to log server(let's say central server)

```bash
   
   run copy.sh
  
```
# all the scripts are merged into one dashboard.sh and convert into a utility dashboard

```bash
   
   chmod +x utilityY
   ./utilityY -lg 
  ```
this will generate the logs.


```bash
   ./utilityY -lt
  ```
this will transfer the logs

# configuration at central erver named as 'log server'

the files generated at remote log server let's say (directory_1->log__file1.txt) .

 The file in log server is saved as directory_1_log_file1.txt so as to clearify from where the file has been coming.

 # utilities designed under log server
