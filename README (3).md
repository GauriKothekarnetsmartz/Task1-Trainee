## Installation
you can directly clone the repository 

or

download setup.sh

if access denied run the below mentioned command

```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh  
```
```bash
   ./setup.sh  
```
It will create setup in your file .
you can check using 

```bash
   ls  
```


# working of remote directories

# the file autogeneratecopy.sh contains the coding logic for generating logs and transferring them .
# utility is designed for both work to run simultaneously

```bash
   ./utility  
```
# it will prompt the option
```bash
   ./utility -logc  
```

The above functionality generate remote servers(lets say directory_1 and so on )  and in these directories  automatic log files generate every 5 seconds in every directory and directory number also auto increase.

# working of centralised server.
files are coming from remote servers continously . Here the files are generated by their remote server name as prefix in order to understand about the source of file.

# configuration at central server named as 'log server'

The files generated at remote log server let's say (directory_1->log__file1.txt) .

The file in log server is saved as directory_1_log_file1.txt so as to clearify from where the file has been coming.

 # utilities designed under log server

 1. To monitor live logs using tail command . It also checks for live errors in the file and send alert to slack   channel continuously if threshold exceeds.

 ```bash
   
   ./watch.sh
  
```
 
 2. To monitor the scanning of lines in files along with % of lines scanned and it also tells if the file has already been scanned.
 ```bash
   
   ./dash.sh
  
```
 3. To search the error using status code such as error 404
 ```bash
   
   ./error_search.sh
  
```
 4. To search the error using timestamp range
 ```bash
   
   ./time_search.sh
  
```
 5. To search the logs of certain days ago
 ```bash
   
   ./daysago.sh
  
```

 # all the scripts are merged  into a utility dashboard

 #steps  to run the utility

 if access denied run the below mentioned command
 
 ```bash
   
   chmod +x ./dashboard 
  
```
and run

```bash
   
   ./dashboard 
  
```
# it will list down the flag
1. Watch the dashboard
   run
   ```bash
   
   ./dashboard -w
  
```
2.for error search
```bash
   
   ./dashboard -es
  
```
3.Get logs from a certain number of days ago
```bash
   
   ./dashboard -d
  
```
4.Search for specific errors
```bash
   
   ./dashboard -es
  
```
5.per: Analyze percentage of lines of code


   ```bash
   
   ./dashboard -per
  
```
